  text: 'Dear mr. {0}


    As the world has been working together to help {1} to fight the forest fires that
    have killed millions of exotic animals, we have created a virus that can possibly
    kill most of the population.


    This virus has the same symptoms the flu but deadly, so it is hard to track down.
    We are planning to release this virus to everyone who is against our regime. We
    already have found a cure for this deadly virus and we will distribute it when
    most of the opposition have been infected by the virus.


    My country will help you as much as we can so that we can both change the world
    to a better place.


    Sincerely,


    .......'
